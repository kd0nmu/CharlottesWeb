"""
This is a program to compute the numbers within a collatz sequence.
Collatz Sequence: if n is odd n=3x+1 ; if n is even n=n/2

Collatz Conjecture: "Every Collatz sequence eventually attains the value 1".

Although I have had some thoughts on the conjecture,
I will not attempt any sort of proof:
    There is a symantics problem: what does it mean to "attain the value of 1"?:
        Obviously, it cannot mean that it ends at 1, because 1 is within a loop
        The same for 2 and 4, as they are also within a loop
        If "attains" means "stops at", then no numbers would actually attain a value of 1
    I am also interested to know if there are other similar algorithms
        does 5n+1 show similar behaviour? is there a loop containing 1?
        what about 3n-1?
    What about zero? is it odd or even?

Ignoring the existential questions, 
we can write a simple program to explore the similar algorithms.
This is more of a programming exercise to try to practice with:
    generators (for efficiently iterating over large ranges)
    the operators library (why use this library, rather than the +,-,/,* operators?)
    counting (how many iterations before reaching 1)
    wrappers (the counting library uses wrappers)
    plots and graphs (what interesting ways can we show the output?)
    
This problem is also an example of an accumulation of knowledge:
    We are building a set of numbers for which the conjecture is true
    Subsequent tests only need to determine if the output is already within the set
    For large numbers, it is less costly to check if a number is in a set, than to repeat the calculation
    The optimal soluction incorporates set comparison logic

"""
We have functions to:
    calculate the next collatz number
    list the numbers in a sequence
    stop the algorithm when it reaches the 1,2,4 loop
    pass multiple values to the sequence generator

now we need to think about how we will use this information:
    create a directed graph of the output?
    do we want a list of the values known to be true?
    do we want to learn what values are true?
        Should this knowledge be referenced when calculating new collatz sequences?
        Should we compare sets or true together?

lets make functions to...
    Generate a sequence of inputs until stopped by operator
    Create Graph objects to store outputs
    Create visual plots of the data being generated
